## Docs

The command line interface is your interface to the world of DalekJS.
This is the way to run your tests.
There might be a web interface to Dalek in the future, but as long as there is not, you have to deal with this;
But hey, this isn't difficult & I know you can do it!

It can be installed with the following command:

```
$ npm install -g dalek-cli
```

Available options:

  > --version, -v   Shows the version of the dalek-cli & local dalek installation

  > --reporter, -r  Reporter(s) you would like to invoke

  > --driver, -d    Driver(s) you would like to invoke

  > --browser, -b   Browser(s) you would like to invoke

  > --viewport      Viewport dimensions you would like to invoke
  
  > --logLevel, -l  Log level, controls the amount of information outputted to the console (0 to 5)
  
  > --remote        Starts a dalek host server for clients to connect to

  > --nocolors     Disable colorized output in the console

  > --nosymbols    Disable UTF-8 symbols in the console
