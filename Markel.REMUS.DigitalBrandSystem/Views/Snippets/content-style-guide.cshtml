            <h1>Content style guide</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>Within the Markel style it states:</h2>
                <blockquote>We are encouraged to look for a better way to do things&hellip;to challenge management. We have the ability to make decisions or alter a course quickly. The Markel approach is one of spontaneity and flexibility. This requires a respect for authority but a disdain of bureaucracy.</blockquote>
                <p>With this phrase in mind, this style guide has been put together to both respect the authority of our industry and to challenge the bureaucracy in the language used. It is designed to position Markel as ‘the easy insurer to deal with, we speak your language, but in a human way’. It will make content much easier to write, giving enough flexibility to the author without compromising the brand. It simplifies the language used to create consistency across our digital channels, to ensure that all our digital content is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>concise and to the point</li>
                    <li>simple and clear</li>
                    <li>easy for the user to scan read</li>
                    <li>written in plain English (or relevant other language)</li>
                    <li>consistent with all other communication</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Ampersands (&)</h2>
            <p>Ampersands (&) can only be used within product names and divisions when appearing in a headline, in all other places – including product names and divisions written as part of a sentence – the word ‘and’ should be written in full.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Button labels</h2>
            <p>If the button is an action start the button label with an action word before the name of the thing that has the action, eg 'get a quote', 'bind policy', 'start a new quote', 'edit application'. If the button lead to another page then only use the name of the page to be displayed, eg ‘application’, ‘policy’, ‘quote’.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Bullet points and numbered lists</h2>

            <p>You may use bullets points to make the the content easier for the user to read, but please ensure that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>there is always a lead-in line, which could be a headline or sub-heading</li>
                <li>the lead-in line ends with a colon (:) unless the lead-in end in a question mark (?)</li>
                <li>each bullet point makes sense following the lead-in line</li>
                <li>each bullet point begins with a lowercase letter, unless it is a name (see below)</li>
                <li>avoid full points in bullet points, try to start a new bullet point or use commas (,) or semi-colons (;)</li>
                <li>there is no full point at the end of any bullet points, including the last</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Where a full sentence is required – and there are no alternatives:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>start each bullet point in the list with a capital letter</li>
                <li>end each bullet point in the list with a full point</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Where a bullet point list is used as a list after a question:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>end the lead-in line or question with a question mark (?)</li>
                <li>each bullet point should then follow the general rules set out above</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Where a bullet point list is used as a collection of answers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>end the lead-in line or question with a colon (:)</li>
                <li>start each bullet point with a capital letter</li>
                <li>end each bullet point with a question mark (?)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Where a bullet point list is used to as part of a list within a question:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>end the lead-in line or question with a colon (:)</li>
                <li>start each bullet point with a lowercase letter</li>
                <li>do not use any punctuation at the end of each bullet point</li>
                <li>end the last bullet point with a question mark (?)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If a numbered list is used to indicate steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>each list item should start with a capital letter</li>
                <li>each list item should end with a full point</li>
                <li>each list item should be a complete step and therefore a sentence</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If a numbered list is used for a list – if possible convert to a bullet point list – otherwise ensure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>each list item starts with a lowercase letter</li>
                <li>each list item ends with no punctuation, including the last item</li>
                <li>if sentences cannot be avoided, then each item should appear as a complete sentence with a capital letter at the start and a full point at the end</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Indented numbered lists:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>use numbers for the first level
                    <ol>
                        <li>use letters for the second level
                            <ol>
                                <li>use roman numerals for the third level</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Capitalisation</h2>
            <p>AVOID THE USE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL LETTERS AS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE USER TO READ. A small amount of capital letters can be used to emphasise a specific phrase that is not expected, eg ‘What is NOT included’.</p>
            <p>NOTE: The exception to this is when used in legal wording to highlight headlines and important phrases which do not form part of the legal contract.</p>

            <p>We use sentence case for all content, therefore all content (eg headlines or sentences) begins with a capital letter, and all other words have a lowercase first letter. The exception to this is where a word is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a name</li>
                <li>a brand name</li>
                <li>a product name (see ‘product names’ below)</li>
                <li>the word ‘Policy’ when referring to the policy that the user is buying</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Capitals should not be used for titles, eg chief executive NOT Chief Executive; and not for business lines, eg directors and officers liability NOT Directors and Officers Liability except when, in both instances, they are being used as headings – as in the title for a presentation – or on their own as an email or letter sign off, or a contact us box. They should appear as below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>James Hastings</li>
                <li>Managing Director</li>
                <li>Professional & Financial Risks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>NOTE: There is an exception within the legal wording where certain words require a capital letter as they refer to a definition detailed elsewhere in the document.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Colon (:)</h2>
            <p>A colon should only be used to introduce a list, it should never be used before a text input or at the end of a headline.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Commas (,)</h2>
            <p>Avoid over use of commas (,) as they make the content more conversational and often more than is required. Use a dash (–) to split sentences up instead of commas.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Date format</h2>
            <p>The date should appear in a localised format, eg in Canada the date always appears as 'September 9, 2014’ (Month DD, YYYY).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>eg, etc, ie, nb</h2>
            <p>Do not add full points after or between the letters of these commonly used notations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Front load headlines</h2>
            <p>Front load all headlines with the most important information first, this help the user to scan and make the whole content more concise and to the point.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Link text</h2>
            <p>Ensure that any link text used describes the outcome of the link to the user, eg ‘home page’ NOT ‘click here'</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Numbers and currency</h2>
            <p>Numbers below 10 (1 to 9) are written in full when appearing within a sentence or title, unless they appear within a price or percentage or refer to a number elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Numbers are formatted with a comma (,) separating each 3 digits and a full point (.) between the number and it’s decimal places, where the decimal places are ’0’ they are not required, eg 1,000,000 NOT 1000000.00. The currency sign is displayed in the relevant place according the the currency being used, eg $100, £100, 100€.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Modern English</h2>
            <p>Where possible use modern, conversational phrases as alternatives to longer ‘official’ phrases, eg shorten ‘quotation’ to ‘quote’ or use ‘Cover confirmed’ instead of ‘Confirmation of cover’.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Page titles and headlines</h2>
            <p>A page title should be concise, to the point and descriptive of the page. A page title should avoid punctuation or formatting as a sentence. Use a colon to split a sentence into smaller parts, eg ‘Miscellaneous errors & omissions: disclosure questions' NOT 'Disclosure questions for Miscellaneous errors & omissions policy’.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Product names</h2>
            <p>Product names always begin with a capital letter, all other words in the name begin with a lowercase letter, for example: ‘Miscellaneous errors & omissions’ NOT ‘Miscellaneous Errors & Omissions’. Also the use of an ampersand (&) is permitted within a product name except if written as part of a sentence.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>NOTE: Within legal documents – such as policies and wording – a product name may be written using initial capital letters or all in upper case.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p>Single quotes are used to highlight words or phrases which reference another part of text such as referring to a button on a screen within FAQs.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Spaces</h2>
            <p>Use a single space between sentences not a double space.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Telephone numbers</h2>
            <p>Format telephone numbers according to the local format for the phone numbers, using the relevant characters between number sets. The phone number should be tested as a link on a mobile device to ensure that it calls the correct number, eg do not use brackets '()’ within the number.</p>
            <p>When displaying an international phone number the international dialling code should appear in the format ‘+44’ followed by the local number. DO NOT show the ‘(0)’ as this will not work on a mobile device.</p>
            <p>Ensure that the phone number is split into easy to read chunks and including any additional information required by the user to call (eg international codes). Avoid using ’T:’, ‘Tel’ etc, use the full word instead if required.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>&hellip;</h2>
            <p>Three dots may only be used following words such as ‘and more’ to suggest that there are more options available, just not displayed.</p>
